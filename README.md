# Advent of Code 2017

I decided to give [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017) a chance this year, after failing miserably last year because I didn't get GHC to run on my computer. I'll be trying to compete each day using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (using [Stack](https://haskellstack.org)) until I get fed up with it.
